I visited the RISD Museum in Providence, RI, today, to spend some time taking my customary Long Look at a number of works.

I would not have been surprised to see "1948" on the gallery tag of this Charles Sheeler painting -- but this 1916 work, "American," is a painting of an American future of quickly constructed angles.

Sitting with this painting made me wonder, did Sheeler complete the final color layer in a single sitting? It has the joyful obsessiveness of a kid with a new flat of markers. How he gets this effect with brushes is an interesting question -- the strokes look a lot like hard pressure, up and down, gleefully scrubbing back and forth but never quite covering any surface he's presented with the black outlines of forms.

All of this sounds like  the kind of shallow slam that some will level against an artwork: "My kid could do that." And while it's true I'm not sensing a lot of rigor from this particular work. At a quick glance, it seems unfinished, but maybe that's the point. One floor down, the museum was hosting a massive exhibition of Gorham silver. No one could say that any of it was anything less than exquisitely, and totally, finished. Isn't that what art is "supposed to be"? a way to show us what something looks like when it's perfect...when it's done?

Maybe. But what Sheeler seems to be showing us here is the first draft, the idea, before it all gets worked out and finished. I think there's some value to preserving those first delicate sparks, not just the masterful finished works.

And nearly in the center of the painting, a bifurcated window, something we as humans can barely see as anything other than a set of eyes: this is a painting that looks back at us, waiting for us to figure it out, to work it out, to keep at it until we're done, when things may look very, very different.
