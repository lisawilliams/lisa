### Dear Colleague,

Thank you so much for your interest in *Intro to Coding for Journalists.*

Together with a diverse team of students -- graduate, undergraduate, j-school students, computer science students -- our group has been meeting each week to develop and refine the syllabus for a semester-long intro-to-coding course tailored for journalism students.

#### About our group

Full Stack Journalists is an informal club, open to both BU students and professionals in the field. Founded by adjunct professor Lisa Williams and BU journalism graduate student Samata Joshi, the group meets each Friday to learn skills by building and testing class materials, sample code, and exercises that we hope will be used when the course is taught 'live.'

### Collaborative approach

I have really come to value the collaborative approach of developing a syllabus and course material alongside students who really care about the topic. The syllabus has had important changes in focus and skills covered based on both student need and our knowledge of newsroom demand for skills.

### Why?

We believe that coding skills will make Boston University journalism students more competitive in the job market. We also believe that giving more young journalists these skills can only help our profession.

### Why now?

In "Teaching Data and Computational Journalism," Cindy Royal and Charles Berret looked at the programs of 113 college and university journalism departments in the US. In 2016, only 59 of the 113 offered any data journalism courses, and of those, only 18 offered more than one course or any advanced or computational journalism courses.

This gap, of course, will narrow. We believe by adding this now, we can join the ranks of the more advanced programs in the US.

### Online News Association Support

Our group was lucky enough to win a fellowship from the Online News Association, which will provide us with connections to instructors and students at other institutions who will help us both sharpen and broaden our focus. We have been invited to present our work at ONA's annual conference in September. Our group will continue to meet over the summer to build out individual class modules which we will present at the conference for feedback.

With great regard,

Lisa Williams, instructor and cofounder
