A catalog of the artworks in my current collection. For background on what I collect and why, see [How I Became An Art Collector](http://localhost:4000/lisa/art/2017/08/18/art-collector.html).

I still have a lot of work to do here, adding images to items. I may choose to install a Jekyll gallery plugin at some point. But this exists to help me keep track of my growing art collection, in particular, when works were made and when I acquired them.
