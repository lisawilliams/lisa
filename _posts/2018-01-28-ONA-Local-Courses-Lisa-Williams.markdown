The #ONALocal Speakers' Bureau brings talented trainers to do workshops at local ONA chapters -- for free!

Local chapters can request me to teach the following workshops between now and July 2018. 

## Fundamentals of Data Journalism

Want to get into data journalism but not sure where to get started? This workshop will give you an overview of current approaches, tools, and practices.  In addition, you will leave with three new skills after having built your own data-driven visualizations. This is a hands on workshop! Bring a laptop.

## Building an award winning newsletter

Lisa Williams developed The Magic Pill, an 'audio newsletter' which won the Edward J. Murrow Award for Excellence in Innovation. In this workshop, you'll see examples of best practices from the field and learn an approach to starting new newsletters that succeed, and retooling existing newsletters for better performance.

## Immersive Journalism hands-on workshop

Like Snowfall, or those other beautifully scrolling, immersive feature presentations of longform pieces? Learn how to build one that grabs the audience, looks great on a big screen or a phone -- from scratch yourself. A great portfolio project to show potential and existing employers to demonstrate your digital skills.
