As I passed into the region of grief and bereavement after my partner died, I was disappointed at the poor quality of the Google-able resources on the topic of grief and bereavement. Too many simply had the same unhelpful five bullet points ("You're going to feel bad for awhile, maybe a long while." No, really?) or parroted Kubler-Ross's stages of grief, which Kubler-Ross herself came to doubt before she died.

Below are the books, articles, and scholarly papers which I found useful and which informed my own approach to grief recovery.

11/12/17: I have much more work to do on this list, and many more resources to add. This document represents a 'pause point' in my work in creating it.

Jarman spent a year talking to everyone from bereavement counselors to artists about their experiences with death and bereavement:

*Even after finishing this project, I haven't "gotten over" death. I'm pretty sure there's no getting over it. But in talking to people who have found ways through, under, and around it, I'm measurably less terrified than I used to be. While I edited interviews for length and clarity, it was important to me to let these conversations roam free. My goal is not to indulge in a cheeky metaphor about the complexity of death itself -- which truly will not be compartmentalized -- but to subvert the now-ubiquitous TED Talk paradigm of tidy stories fit for on-the-go consumption.*

Bless you, child. Note: you may breathe easy in the knowledge that this compilation of resources will not contain a single TED talk.

**[Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524732680/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lisawilliam0a-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1524732680&linkId=53dc24752adb3c6bbe9d7d8b472066b3)**, Sheryl Sandberg

Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, wrote this book after her husband died suddenly. While it has many excellent suggestions, it suffers from some of the same problems of Sandberg's book on women and leadership in the workplace, Lean In. Many people criticized Lean In for not seeming to countenance that leaning in is highly dependent on things like access to childcare; Option B also assumes that reaching out is always the right answer, and that everyone will receive the same response to asking for help that she did as a straight married woman. However, her focus on making a decision to recover and thrive was one I found interesting and helpful.

**[The Grief Recovery Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061686077/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lisawilliam0a-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0061686077&linkId=1b477f89d37f6004470c98bcdffd08e3)** by John James and Russell Friedman. A very step-by step, action-oriented approach to grief with writing exercises. I enjoyed the straightforward, active approach, but ultimately I opted not to follow through with the exercises, which I felt focused on closure over continuing bonds. YMMV.

_[Grief and Bereavement: What Psychiatrists Need To Know](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2691160/)_

A good overview of how professionals currently think about grief and bereavement, including the difference between "normal" and "complicated" grief. Note: professionals' ideas about nearly every aspect of psychiatry has changed radically over the last 100 years. Nothing is the last word, and your lived experience is more important than anyone's theory.

_[Is Rumination after Bereavement Linked with Loss Avoidance? Evidence from Eye-Tracking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4139328/)_

Can't stop thinking about your loss? Can't stop thinking that there will be more losses now? Researchers wanted to know if this common bereavement phenomenon was linked to avoidance of other reminders of the loss, like pictures of the person who died. Why are they interested in that? It turns out that avoiding pictures, places you've been together, or other reminders, are correlated with worse moods, depression, etc. What they found was that the constant thinking + the avoidance did go together.

## Disenfranchised Grief

Disenfranchised grief happens when a person dies and that person's family or community may not recognize or approve of your relationship with that person. It's common among LGBT people. It can include being left out of the obituary, excluded from planning or participating fully in funeral rituals, and being excluded in planning for a person's legacy. LGBT people may also face homophobic attacks when they talk about the death of a loved one.

## Grief recovery methods & grief therapy modalities

In my reading I came across several grief therapy modalities that are well-established enough that professionals can seek certifications in that particular grief therapy method. Among them are The Grief Recovery Method and Complicated Grief Treatment.

The Grief Therapy Method involves a process of walking through a review of a relationship with a person you've lost, culminating in writing them a letter that closes with goodbye. The creators of the method also wrote a book, [The Grief Recovery Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NLKYIS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).

[The Center for Complicated Grief](https://complicatedgrief.columbia.edu/) produces a handbook for therapists who are treating patients with complicated grief. The method involves retelling the story of the death out loud, recording it, and relistening to it between sessions with a therapist, among other things.

*There are many other grief recovery modalities, of course. Personal note: I did not use either of these modalities. I objected to the insistence in Grief Recovery Method that all letters to the person you've lost end with 'Goodbye.' I actually don't want to say goodbye. Complicated Grief Therapy, with its repeated retellings and relistenings, is not something that I personally would engage in.*
