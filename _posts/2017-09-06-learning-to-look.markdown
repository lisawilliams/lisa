I knew nothing worth knowing about art when I met her, nor was I particularly motivated to learn. Art museums bored me; when I went to one, I rarely remembered any individual work -- I remembered the visit. I'd been to Florence and passed on the opportunity to see the Uffizi because the process of getting tickets involved massing a counter (Italians never seemed to get in line for everything, an attitude I respected but didn't leave me with a desire to participate in the scrum if I didn't have to).

I wasn't interested in art. I was interested in her, with that glittering enthusiasm that fresh love brings.

So at first I wasn't looking at art. I was looking at her looking at art.

I quickly realized that I'd been approaching museums like the worst kind of blockhead. Why had I never thought, "You know, taking the number of works in the museum and dividing by the number of minutes I'm going to be here is probably not the best way to experience this."  She rushed by many pieces, even giving some a dismissive hand gesture that seemed totally out of character. Now I was learning something: she would not give that hand gesture even to the most obnoxious bro on the bus for mansitting across three seats, texting obliviously, while an older man and a woman holding a baby looked on, but here, she would take up the sceptre and decide who got to stand in her presence and who wasn't worth her time.

It was a revelation, but still, one about her, not about art.

It might never have been about the art if I hadn't been sick that day. We were in DC, indulging ourselves with the amazing free museums. I was still recovering from a serious illness , and going from our hotel in Dupont Circle to the museum district was the longest walk I'd taken in quite awhile, and suddenly I could feel the insult to my body that the surgery had been. Usually, I slowed my walking pace to meet hers; now, it was an effort for me to keep up with her, even though I knew she was not going very fast.

Inside the museum, she sped up, dismissing ranks of courtiers lining the walls until she found one that was worthy of her attention. Fortunately for me, there was a wide bench with a leather padded top in front of it.

I sat. I watched her watching the work. And I watched her walk off, regal, crisp, focused, making no move to take her long wool coat off. I, on the other hand, was dying, overheated from the exertion but torn between the effort of standing to follow her and the effort of taking my jacket off.

I wanted to get up, but it just seemed like a bad idea. So there I sat, a trickle of sweat running down from my hairline into my collar.

I took off the wool tweed hat she'd given me as a gift, and pulled off my gloves, putting them in the hat beside me on the bench. I was alone in the gallery; well, there were no other humans there. But I had already made the surprising discovery that being alone in a room with a work of real mastery was not the same as being alone in a room. Great art has a palpable presence; you can feel it. Here I had eight companions, all of them strangers to me. Some I got to know later, like Kehinde Wiley and Louise Bourgeois.

I unbuttoned my coat and took it off awkwardly, favoring my left side. As I twisted to my right, something gold caught my eye. I extricated myself from my coat, my shirt still stuck to my back, and turned to face it.

A huge piece, at least ten feet high, fourteen feet wide. Not a painting, but not a sculpture. A hanging? A weaving? But made of metal.
