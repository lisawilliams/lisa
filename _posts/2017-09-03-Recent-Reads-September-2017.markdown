![Ghost story: Boo](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/rugrats/images/7/7f/Ghost_Story_title_card.png/revision/latest?cb=20160227042144)

**Boo:** Comics illustrator Adam Ellis is [telling a ghost story on Twitter](https://storify.com/moby_dickhead/dear-david):

> I had another dream a few nights later, where I was in a library and a girl came up to me and said, "You've seen Dear David, haven't you?" I was like, "Who?" And she said, "Dear David. You saw him." She continued, "He's dead. He only appears at midnight, and you can ask him two questions if you said 'Dear David' first." Then she added, "But never try to ask him a third question, or he'll kill you."

**Girl power, art edition:** Female artists are a lot less likely to get gallery representation or solo shows. [But when they break through, it's big, says a recent study](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-new-study-yale-grads-gender-pay-gap-artists-simple):

> Although female BFA and MFA graduates from Yale University School of Art are significantly less likely than male graduates to see their work sold at auction, those who do sell work at auction command higher average sale prices, according to a recent paper by William N. Goetzmann, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management.That suggests that while women artists face barriers in the art market, those who manage to break through to the upper echelons of the art market are met with enthusiasm.

**That's bullshit.** Many in the news industry are chagrined by how little facts or fact-checking seems to matter to the current president, who has topped [1,000 false or misleading statements since taking office](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/08/22/president-trumps-list-of-false-and-misleading-claims-tops-1000/), according to the Washington Post and Politifact. But fact-checking is useless against bullshit. As defined in Harry Frankfurt's essay for our time, "On Bullshit," bullshit happens when a person simply doesn't care whether or not what they are saying is true or false:

> For the bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.

**Speaking of bullshit**, designer Natasha Jen wants you to put down your sharpies and Post-Its, because [Design Thinking is Bullshit](http://99u.com/videos/55967/natasha-jen-design-thinking-is-bullshit). This one's of especial use to my software and news pals who are trapped in useless meetings where they try to do 'design thinking' on that new app or website.

**Just letting you know we still don't like you:** In Nashville this month, a coalition of anti-gay Christians got together and issued a statement now known as the Nashville Statement. In response is Reverend Nadia Bolz-Weber's Denver Statement, dishing some fine theological side-eye. First, an excerpt from the Nashville Statement:

>Article 2 **(Nashville)** WE AFFIRM that God’s revealed will for all people is chastity outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage. WE DENY that any affections, desires, or commitments ever justify sexual intercourse before or outside marriage; nor do they justify any form of sexual immorality.

In response, the Denver Statement:

>**(Denver)** WE AFFIRM that God created us as sexual beings in endless variety.  WE DENY that the only type of sexual expression that can be considered holy is between a cis-gendered, heterosexual, married couple who waited to have sex until they were married. But if you fit in that group, good for you, we have no problem with your lifestyle choices.
