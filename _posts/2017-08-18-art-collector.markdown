I admit, there was a time when I was one of those awful people who might be confronted with this:

...and think: 'My kid could do that.'

Today I collect contemporary abstract art, primarily from emerging artists, both paintings and works on paper.

How did I get here?

First let's back up a minute and unpack that sentence: 'Today I collect contemporary abstract art, primarily from emerging artists, both paintings and works on paper.'

Wait, what?

Okay, let's take it word by word. First, lets start with 'I collect.' That means I am an art collector. Sounds fancy, right? You know what? It is kinda fancy! But I also drive a used Toyota. I used to think that if an ordinary person like me wanted art in their living space, their only option was really to buy prints and frame them. *Real, original art* was going to be way too expensive for any regular person like me.

Next up is 'abstract.' That means 'not representational or figurative.' I don't own many pictures of things: I don't collect landscapes or still lifes or portraits (although I do own several portraits). We'll revisit abstract later, since this is an essay about how someone from outside the art world can develop their own sense of whether a work that 'isn't about anything' is any good or not.

That brings us to 'contemporary.' Contemporary is works by artists who are alive today. And 'emerging' means 'not yet established or well-known.' That means artists who may not yet be making a living being artists. Why do I collect contemporary works by emerging artists? Because that's what I can afford with my regular-person budget :)

Now we're up to 'paintings.' That seems pretty obvious, right? And it is. I happen to own a lot of paintings on things other than canvas; my partner Heather painted mainly on masonite; I have others that were painted on artboard or on wood panels. I'm not sure why that is, but I found I have seen a lot of works created that way that mean enough to me that I want to take them home. Lastly, I also collect 'works on paper.' This is pretty much what it sounds like, but you can put a lot of things on paper. You could have a drawing, a watercolor, a collage, an artist could use colored pencil, ink, powdered pigment, I even own one work that incorporates gold leaf on paper. Works on paper are great if you're collecting on a regular-person budget because many of them are small and less expensive than artworks in other mediums.

There was a time when I would have been intimidated to visit an art gallery. It's a lot like going into a shop where there are no prices on things: I assumed everything was really expensive, and I didn't want to ask. I also didn't really feel like I knew what I liked.

All that changed when I started dating an artist. Suddenly I realized that I never looked anywhere except where I was going. I didn't look up, or around; I mainly used my eyes so I wouldn't crash into things as I hurtled through life at top speed. Heather was always looking, well, not straight ahead. And when I turned my head and looked at what she was looking at, I was looking at something interesting, mysterious, beautiful. Or litter. She really hated litter.

I was also seeing the creation of artworks, meeting other artists who were her friends, and going to art show openings at galleries with her. 'Don't buy prints!' she'd say. 'Buy originals!' Heather was normally pretty shy and retiring, but she had strong opinions about art.

The first originals that hung on my walls at home were works of hers.

Over time, I started buying works, mainly at openings that I attended with her.
