I'm pleased to announce that our working group on data visualization and computer science for students in the journalism program at Boston University will continue in 2019.
This semester we will cover data journalism, immersive features built
with modern web frameworks, and scroll-driven storytelling. Our goal will be to work together on projects,
with the goal of creating projects interesting and useful enough to share.

**Organizers:** Lisa Williams and Samata Joshi

We're keeping the group small and participation is limited; if you want
to participate, let us know by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhC6QR9eTbg1G0t2K-DJDVaB5XS2i4PAMpmhyzcZWhq-QbYA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

**When & Where?** Groups will happen at 6:30 on the dates below at the BUild Lab.
Register with the form above. Participants will receive an address and room
number as well as other details before the meeting.

# January 9: Coding Tools & Data Journalism

We'll install and begin to use foundational coding tools -- a version control
system (Git) and a text editor (Atom or Sublime Text). We'll also browse
the code repositories of major news organizations and provide an overview of
common tools and frameworks used by newsroom technologists.

We will complete a data feature using current data on a real public policy
issue.

# Feb 6: Data Journalism and Tableau

We will take a brief tour of state-of-the-art data journalism and walk through the interface of Tableau, a data visualization tool. Scraping and cleaning data, as well as sources of public data, will also be covered.

# March 21: Immersives and scroll-driven storytelling

We will use Bootstrap and Javascript to build an immersive feature package.
We might get into using NPR or NYT app templates.


### Tech Requirements

You will need your own laptop. You can bring a Windows laptop but we may not be
able to support you in installing and configuring tools.
Best choice: Mac laptop with OSX 10.8 or higher.
