This repository is the back end for [a blog of personal essays, commentaries, notes and guides by Lisa Williams](http://lisawilliams.github.io/lisa/).

I primarily write about contemporary art and tech projects I create or collaborate on.
I use a naming convention for my posts. All posts about projects have a title beginning with "Building." All essays about individual works of art have titles that start with the phrase "Long Look." Posts about visits to galleries or shows are prefixed by "Gallery Report" or "Museum Report."

The blog uses Jekyll, a blogging system that creates a static site (look, Ma, no database!) and hosted on Github pages.

I use an issue-driven development queue to make changes to the blog infrastructure, and create a new Markdown file for each post. I publish new posts using Git, committing the changes and pushing them to Github. The site mirrors the gh-pages branch of this repository.

I edit my posts using the Atom text editor.
