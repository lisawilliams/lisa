This repository is the back end for [a blog of personal essays, commentaries, notes and guides by Lisa Williams](http://lisawilliams.github.io/lisa/).

I primarily write about contemporary art and tech projects I create or collaborate on.

The blog uses Jekyll, a blogging system that creates a static site (look, Ma, no database!) and hosted on Github pages.

I use an issue-driven development queue to make changes to the blog infrastructure, and create a new Markdown file for each post. I publish new posts using Git, committing the changes and pushing them to Github. The site mirrors the gh-pages branch of this repository.

I edit my posts using the Atom text editor.
